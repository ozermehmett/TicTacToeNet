- **tic_tac_toe/**: Contains the TicTacToe game logic and board management.
- **utils/**: Includes utility functions for move selection and generation.
- **TrainModel.py**: Script for training the Tic-Tac-Toe AI model.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
- **run_tests.py**: Script for running the project's test cases.
- **start_game.py**: Main script to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game against the AI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`. CUDA version 12.5 is required for GPU acceleration.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ozermehmett/TicTacToeNet.git
    cd TicTacToeNet
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running Tests
To run the project's test cases, use:
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Training the Model
To train the Tic-Tac-Toe AI model, run:
```bash
python TrainModel.py
```

### Running the Game
